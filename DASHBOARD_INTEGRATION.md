# Dashboard Integration Complete

## Overview
The dashboard has been successfully updated to use real user data from the backend database instead of hardcoded values.

## Backend Changes

### New Routes (routes/dashboard.py)
- `/api/dashboard/analytics` - Returns user statistics and analytics data
- `/api/dashboard/recent-activity` - Returns recent user activities (analyses, wardrobe additions)
- `/api/dashboard/style-trends` - Returns style score trends over time for charts

### Analytics Data Includes:
- **Total Analyses**: Count of user's outfit analyses with trend percentage
- **Wardrobe Items**: Count of items in wardrobe with new additions count
- **Recommendations Viewed**: Estimated count based on analyses
- **Style Score Average**: Average overall score from all analyses with improvement trend

### Recent Activity Includes:
- Recent outfit analyses with scores and timestamps
- Recent wardrobe item additions with names and timestamps
- Properly sorted by most recent first

### Style Trends:
- Monthly aggregated style scores over last 6 months
- Includes analysis count per month for chart visualization

## Frontend Changes

### New Service (app/api/services/dashboard-service.ts)
- TypeScript service for calling dashboard endpoints
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Consistent API calling pattern with other services

### Updated Dashboard Page (app/dashboard/page.tsx)
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for data management
- Loading states with skeleton UI
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Real-time data from backend APIs
- Dynamic activity icons based on activity type
- Improved chart placeholder with real data stats

## Features

### Loading States
- Skeleton cards while data loads
- Prevents layout shift during loading

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Real-time Data
- Analytics cards show actual user statistics
- Recent activity shows real user actions
- Style trends reflect actual analysis history

## Authentication
All dashboard endpoints require JWT authentication. The dashboard service automatically includes the auth token from localStorage.

## Testing
- Dashboard endpoints are registered in Flask app with proper CORS
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Error-free React components
- Proper type safety throughout

## Usage
1. User logs in and navigates to dashboard
2. Dashboard automatically fetches real user data
3. Analytics cards update with actual statistics
4. Recent activity shows user's actual actions
5. Style trends chart uses real analysis data

## Future Enhancements
- Replace placeholder chart with actual charting library (Chart.js, Recharts, etc.)
- Add more detailed analytics (category breakdowns, time-based analysis)
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
- Add export functionality for analytics data
