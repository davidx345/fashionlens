# Deprecated Services

## transformer_service.py

This service has been deprecated in favor of the Gemini-based AI service. The transformer_service.py file is kept for reference, but is no longer used in the application.

## Reasons for Deprecation:

1. **Server Resource Efficiency**: The local transformer models required significant server resources
2. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Gemini API provides more advanced analysis capabilities
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Cloud-based API reduces the need to maintain and update local ML models
4. **Cost Efficiency**: For the volume of requests we handle, the cloud API is more cost-effective

## Migration Path:

All features previously provided by the transformer service are now implemented in the `gemini_service.py` file and accessed through the `AIAnalysisService` class.

If you need to revert to local model usage for any reason:
1. Reinstall PyTorch and transformers packages
2. Update the `AIAnalysisService` class to use the `TransformerService` instead of `GeminiService`
